   ASCII
          American Standard Code for Information Interchange;
          technically, this refers to the encoding scheme whereby the
          internally stored binary numbers used by computers correspond
          to human-readable symbols like "A", but in common usage on the
          net, ASCII also refers to anything that's made of standard text
          characters: "@}--,--`---" is an ASCII rose, for example.

   Flame
          An emotional, often personal attack on another person's

          idiot" is.

   Flamebait
          Something posted publicly that appears designed to inspire
          flames; usually this is a postion that is not only likely to
          annoy a lot of people but is also worded in such a way as to
          arouse the ire of readers.
