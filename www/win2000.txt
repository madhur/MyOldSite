Q I just noticed that the view for thumbnails no longer works. In addition, when I right click a .jpg, I don't see  a small image on left as I used to.

A If it's selected and still not working then <a href=http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;192573&Product=win2000 target=_new>Look here</a> and merge this <a href=/files/thumbnail.reg>file</a> into your registry.

Q My computer beeps when I get an error message or certain pop ups that wont display. This has happened since I upgraded from w98 to W2000 pro.

A You can find and configure it under Device Manager|View|Show Hidden Devices|Non Plug and Play|Beep|Action|Properties|Driver, then set the "Startup Type:" to "Disabled"

Q I am new to win 2000.  is there an equivalent to msconfig for win2000???

A Hi - There are several approaches you can use to make controlling the Startup process easier in Win2k.

1) If you still have access to it, you can move a copy of the Win98 msconfig to your \System\ folder and it will work - just ignore any complaints it makes.

2) Much better, you can go here:

<a href=http://www.thetechguide.com/downloads.html> (XP Version which works in Win2k just fine)</a> or here:
<a href=http://www.3feetunder.com/files/win2K_msconfig_setup.exe> (stated to be a Win2k Version - probably the same as the XP)</a> or here:
<a href=http://www.techadvice.com/win2000/m/msconfig_w2k.htm> and download  msconfig.</a>

3) As good, but different, is to go here:
<a href=http://www.mlin.net/StartupCPL.shtml> and get Mike Lin's Startup Control Panel applet</a>.
A somewhat more difficult to use but more extensive program to do the same thing is StartupList from here: <a href=http://www.lurkhere.com/~nicefiles/index.html>http://www.lurkhere.com/~nicefiles/index.html</a>
or even better, Autoruns from here:  <a href=http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/autoruns.shtml>http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/autoruns.shtml</a>

Be very careful about doing any Registry modifications directly unless you're comfortable with this, and be sure that you BACKUP your Registry before making any changes, so that you can recover if something goes wrong. Changes made with StartUpCPL are less likely to cause problems, and are usually a matter of just re-enabling the particular program.  Another program of this type that I can recommend is StartMan, free.  You'll have to get it here:  <a href=http://www.pt.lu/comnet/files/utils/startman10396.exe>http://www.pt.lu/comnet/files/utils/startman10396.exe</a> , as the pcforest site is, sadly, no longer in business.  
Another such free program that I can highly recommend is StartupRun, here:  http://nirsoft.cjb.net/, particularly if you suspect malware problems.   
And finally, StartupCop, here is excellent and allows you to set up multiple "startup profiles": <a href=www.pchelp911.com/files/startcop.zip>www.pchelp911.com/files/startcop.zip</a>. 
If you have problems with >suspected hijackers, you can look up and investigate suspect programs in your StartUp lists here:
<a href=www.pacs-portal.co.uk/startup_pages/startup_full.htm>www.pacs-portal.co.uk/startup_pages/startup_full.htm</a>(Recommended)
<a href=www.3feetunder.com/krick/startup/list.html>www.3feetunder.com/krick/startup/list.html</a>(Recommended)
<a href=www.answersthatwork.com/Tasklist_pages/tasklist.htm>www.answersthatwork.com/Tasklist_pages/tasklist.htm</a>(Recommended)


All work fine for controlling startups, however, I would recommend getting both of the last two. They're both free, and each has some advantages.  For example, the XP msconfig also gives you some visibility/control over services, while Mike's applet offers much better startup control.
Also, you should read and print out/save for future reference mskb article Q179365 here:
<a href=support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q179365>support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q179365</a> which will tell you the order in which things get loaded.

Q I know I have only 1, a P4 3Ghz.   Why does win2k prosp4 show status of 2 in the taskmanager.

A Because all of the following are true in your case:
1.)  You put in a HyperThreading capable P4. Lets abbreviate it as HT.
2.)  You have HT enabled in your BIOS.
3.)  HT makes each physical processor appear as two logical processors to the OS.
4.)  W2K doesn't know how to detect a single physical processor with two logical processors - it only sees the two logical processors and thinks each is a separate physical processor.  NT4 behaves the same way.

XP and W2K3 - with the right patches - can detect HT and will correctly report the number of processors.

Q 100%CPU usage by svchost+services

A This problem is very common, but unfortunately no single solution exists.

Solutions:

1) Disable MCafee Personal Firewall if you have installed.

2)  So the workaround in my case was:
i. Disable Network Connections service and reboot; verify CPU usage is normal
ii. Re-enable Network Connections service and reboot; hope CPU usage is still OK!

3) Using tlist I found the services that this svchost was managing and began disabling them one at a time. I finally  found the culprit to be the Remote Access Connection  Manager (RasMan). After disabling this service and  rebooting CPU utilization dropped to <5%. I eventually had  to reenable this service for remote access to work but even then the problem did not return. 

4) Try disabling the RPC locator service and see if it helps.

Q DNS Client:Timeout waiting for a transaction response from the DNSCache service)

A Get rid of all the extra entries in the hosts file pointing to 127.0.0.1. I had a machine that I migrated from Win 98, with the same setup in the hosts file. Didn't seem to be a problem on 98, but once I moved to 2000, machine started freezing every half hour or so with two 7011 -- "dnscache timeout" entries in the event log. Very annoying. 
"Spybot - Search & Destroy". It modifies the %root%/winnt/system32/drivers/etc/hosts file by adding a few hundred entries all pointing to 127.0.0.1 which is  the local host.

Q Explorer Folder Pane Grayed Out

A The problem of the Grayed out Explorer Folders Pane has been traced to a single registry key. 

This one:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{EFA24E64-B078-11d0-89E4-00C04FC9E26E}\InProcServer32

The Default value for this key points to the file which builds the Explorer Band. That file is either Shdocvw.dll or Browseui.dll. The file varies according to which version of Internet Explorer is installed. If this entry is not correct, the Pane will not be built. 

Internet Explorer 5.5 uses Browseui.dll
All other Internet Explorer Versions use Shdocvw.dll

Using a registry file and merging that file into the registry can repair the problem on all versions except IE 5.5.

------------------------------------------------

For All Internet Explorer versions EXCEPT IE 5.5

Go to Start>run and type Regedit. Press Enter

Navigate to this key:

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{EFA24E64-B078-11d0-89E4-00C04FC9E26E}\InProcServer32

Highlight InProcServer32 in the left pane. In the right pane, double click on Default. Modify the value data in the box which will come up, by typing in the correct path to shdocvw.dll. Click Ok. Close the Registry.

-------------------------------------------------------
For those of you using Internet Explorer 5.5

Repair Internet Explorer. See if that corrects the situation. If not then doublecheck your installed version of Browseui.dll to be sure it is the correct version for IE 5.5.

To cover all bases, (note: The registry usually doesn't solve the problem for IE 5.5) 
Go to this key:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{EFA24E64-B078-11d0-89E4-00C04FC9E26E}\InProcServer32

Click on InProcServer32 

Make sure the Default in the right pane is the correct path to Browseui.dll.


If none of this helps, you may either Upgrade Internet Explorer or revert to the previous version and/or try another reinstall of Internet Explorer 5.5.

Q When I try to access a share from Win98 machine, I am asked the password for IPC$.

A Sharing requires that you have proper credentials. So, you have to log on in Windows 98 machine with the username and password which exists in the Win2000 machine.

Note that login type in Win98 must be Client for Microsoft Networks.

Otherwise you can enable the guest Account on the machine and add guests to the *Users allowed to connect* in Local Security 
Policy.

Q Whenever Win2000 systems boots, the admin shares like C$,D$,E$ etc

Set the value of : AutoShareServer to 1
Set the value of : AutoShareWks to 1
