If you've ever tried to delete a file in Windows Explorer and received the error message that it could not delete the file/folder because it was in use, this is for you.
<ul>
<li>Close all open programs. 
<li>Open a command prompt. 
<li>Right-click the taskbar, and select Task Manager. 
<li>On the Processes tab, select Explorer.exe, and click the End Process button. 
<li>Minimize Task Manager, but don't close it. 
<li>At the command prompt, use the Delete command to remove the file, and close the command prompt. 
<li>In Task Manager, go to File | New Task (Run). 
<li>In the Create New Task dialog box, enter Explorer.exe, and click OK. 
<li>Close Task Manager. 
</ul>

Ending Explorer.exe should close every program that you have running. This will not help you delete windows files while it's running.

The other way of doing this uses a program called process explorer. It's a very handy freeware application that allows you to search for a filename to see what process is using it.
