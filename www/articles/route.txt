Host routes define the interface (e.g. eth0, ppp0, eth1, etc.) which should be
used to reach a specific host.

Network routes come in two flavors. There is usually one network route per
interface which is for that interface's "local net".  That is, if eth0 is
123.123.123.123, there will be a network route for 123.123.123.0. 

No gateway is required for such a route because the interface will (and must) 
have the same netmask as this network and is, in fact, on this network. More 
than one route such as this may exist, but only if you have more than one 
interface.

All other network routes must have a gateway specified.  These routes basically
say, "If you have a packet bound for 123.123.124.0, send it to 123.123.123.1" 
(123.123.123.1 is a machine on the local net and thus already reachable, and 
123.123.124.0 is some external net that 123.123.123.1 knows how to reach 
(likely via another interface on that machine)).

You cannot have a gateway that is not on your local network.  Why? Because 
your machine won't know how to reach the gateway.  That's what gateways are for.
There is one special case route, that being the "default route" or 0.0.0.0. 
This is the "route for packets bound for networks that I don't have any other
routes for."  This is really how stuff works.

It is not feasible for your machine to have routes for every network, and since
virtually all of them would go to a local gateway, you need only specify this
route, point it to your local gateway, and there they all go.  It's like, 
"I have _no_clue_ how to reach Fred, so I'll transfer you to Wilma and _she_ 
can deal with you."

As for the "only one route" business, I think you're referring to the fact that 
you wouldn't normally have two _network_ routes for the same network on two 
different interfaces.  Sometimes you may, but if you do, you probably already 
knew everything I just said and are way past that into dual-homing.

*grin*  Note that it is perfectly legit to have a host route on a different 
interface, although I can't think of a good example other than a single, 
isolated machine that for whatever reason you demand is reachable _only_ through 
a certain machine.  The "certain machine" would have a net route for the network 
on say, eth0, and a host route for secluded-machine on say, eth1.  This is fine. 
A host route takes priority over a network route.
