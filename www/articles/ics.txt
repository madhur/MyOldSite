Windows 2000 supports both Network Address Translation (NAT) and Internet
Confection Shading (ICS) allow workgroup users to access to the Internet..
Windows 2000/XP Professional support only ICS. Internet Connection Sharing
(ICS) enables a Windows (Win98SE, Win2K and XP) computer to share its
Internet connection with computers on local area networks. The computer
connecting directly to the Internet and shares its connection with the rest
of the computers on the network called the ICS host. In addition, the ICS
host provides DHCP to ICS clients. Client computers are protected because
they cannot be seen from outside the network. Only the computer running ICS
is seen from the public side.

We assume you have all computers physically connected, and the ICS host have
two network connections: one (for example Internet in our case) for the
Internet such as a dial-up (PPP or ISDN), cable modem, DSL, or other
broadband Ethernet connection, and another one (LAN) , for the local area
network.

Things you should know about ICS

NIC in the ICS server is always 192.168.0.1. All clients will be assigned
other IP addresses in the 192.168.0.x range.
2. You should not enable ICS on the computer as a domain controller, DHCP
server, or DNS server.
3. To enable ICS, you must be logged on as a member of the Administrators
4. You may experience some problems if you use NetMeeting and VPN in your
ICS network.
5. You should have two NICs.
