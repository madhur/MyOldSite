Default gateway is an address to a machine to which a particular host forwards its
request for the packets for which it cannot find particular destination. For ex 
consider a 2 computer lan in which a machine has following routing table:
<pre>
Network Destination        Netmask          Gateway       Interface  Metric
          0.0.0.0          0.0.0.0      192.168.0.1     192.168.0.3       20
        127.0.0.0        255.0.0.0        127.0.0.1       127.0.0.1       1
      192.168.0.0    255.255.255.0      192.168.0.3     192.168.0.3       20	*
      192.168.0.3  255.255.255.255        127.0.0.1       127.0.0.1       20
    192.168.0.255  255.255.255.255      192.168.0.3     192.168.0.3       20
        224.0.0.0        240.0.0.0      192.168.0.3     192.168.0.3       20
  255.255.255.255  255.255.255.255      192.168.0.3     192.168.0.3       1
Default Gateway:       192.168.0.1</pre>

In this table route is defined only for range of ip addresses 192.168.0.x.
If a user tries to access an IP address such as 192.168.1.x the machine instantly
says destination unreachable. If however a default gateway is specified than
that request is forwarded to particular host. Note that source and destination in the packet
are not changed.
