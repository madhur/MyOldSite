<h1 align="center">Usenet</font></h1>
<p>When I started on the Internet, the first thing I explored beside the WWW were 
  chats. However, I didn't like chats very much because I sometimes had the impression 
  that I tried to communicate with primates. So I found the Usenet newsgroups 
  which I like a lot better. I think that's because a chat is a real time medium 
  like the telephone, while Usenet is more like writing letters. You have time 
  to think over your posting before you submit it, and the people you are communicating 
  with hopefully do so as well :-) </p>
<p>I've tried to put together the most important things to pay attention to when 
  posting on the Usenet.</p>
<h3>- Don't do fullquoting (or top posting) </h3>
<p>When answering a post, please don't just quote the full text and write your 
  answer above it, it wastes bandwidth and is annoying because the postings grow 
  bigger and bigger. But also don't quote nothing, it is important that you quote 
  the parts of the texts you are referring to (but only them). A good quoting 
  looks like the following: </p>

<h3>- Don't post binaries </h3>
<p>Except some special groups (which usually carry the word &quot;binary&quot; 
  in their name) binary files are unwanted on the Usenet. Some people download 
  a whole newsgroup, and if there are binary files the amount of data may be much 
  bigger than expected, and if they have only a telephone connection this can 
  also be quite expensive. You'll get badly flamed for this. </p>
<h3>- Read before posting </h3>
<p>People can get quite angry if the same question that has been answered few 
  days before is now asked again. So take a look at the postings that are already 
  there before posting your problem. Also look for something like a FAQ list (list 
  of frequently asked question and the answers), many newsgroup have one that 
  is posted regularly, and you should not dare to ask something already answered 
  there :-) </p>
<h3>- Remember that your postings are archived </h3>
<p>If you don't want your postings to be archived, you have to put the line &quot;X-No-Archive: 
  yes&quot; in the header of your posting or in the first line of the body. But 
  don't count on archives to look at this header. The biggest archive, Google, 
  does, but there are other ones and some people even run their private archives. 
  Also, if people answer you and quote your text it will still be archived. So 
  be aware that what you post on Usenet is forever and there's no way to erase 
  it :-) </p>
