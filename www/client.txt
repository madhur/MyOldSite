VA2Offset is a nifty utility to convert the virtual address seen under debuggers likesoftice,ollydbg etc to offsets of the file. Virtual address supplied can reside in any of the section or in header of the Portable Executable File. 

Currently the program supports only Portable Executable Files. 
I have tested this program on Win98/2000.
