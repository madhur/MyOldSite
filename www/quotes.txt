Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are,
by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
-Brian Kernighan

Intimations of Immortality
==========================
What thought the radiance which
was once so bright
Be now for ever taken from my sight,
Though nothing can bring back the
hour
of splendour in the grass, of glory in
the flower;
We will grieve not; rather find-
Strength in what remains behind
