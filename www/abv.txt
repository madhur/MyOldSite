     READ THIS PAGE FIRST!

     First compiled when I became frustrated while reading magazine
articles, help wanted ads and equipment for sale brochures....all
pertaining to computers....where the following Abbreviations and
Acronyms were used and their meanings were either not known to me
or were not immediately available.  I have actually seen (or have
been told about) these combinations of letters used at one time or
another in magazines, newspapers, handbooks, etc.  They apply to
personal computers, multimedia, communications, programming,
networking, etc......you name it.  This glossary can never be
considered complete so look over the entries and let me have your
feedback.  If you find errors or if you can suggest additions, they
will be most welcome (See NOTE 1).  If you can help, you have my
thanks in advance.

     Keep BABEL on your hard drive or floppy disk or print it and
keep it on your desk (See NOTE 2).  Either way, you will have an
outstanding reference, immediately available.  BABEL is revised
three times a year, in January, May and September so as to keep you
up-to-date.  See APPENDIX A for methods that may be used to
download BABEL in either TEXT, HTML or PALM Format.

     Letter groups followed with " * " were used before 1965.  At
some of these, historical information is noted.  For brief
interpretations of "smiley faces" and other informal expressions
used in electronic mail messages, see APPENDIX B.  For a partial
list of Country Domain Names, see APPENDIX C.

     BABEL is not in the public domain.  It is free for personal use.
When you download it, you agree to the following:  You will only

NOTE 1

        SUBMITTING A NEW ENTRY....Each submitted entry is first
verified before inclusion into BABEL.  Please let me know where
you have seen your submission used or described; i.e., name of
publication, page number, who uses it, where it is used, etc.
Furnish COMPLETE details in order that your entry may be
verified from this end via the Internet

        Submit your entry via e-mail to:  BabelGlossary@erols.com
        Include the word BABEL or GLOSSARY on your Subject line.

NOTE 2

        SAVING AND PRINTING....To have instant access to BABEL,  I
suggest that you download the complete file rather than to search
on line.

        For the HTML version, download babel.html or babelhtm.zip
and save it on a floppy disk or on your hard drive.  Use your browser
to locate any entry instantly.

        For Printing, use the TEXT version.  Download babeltxt.zip,
unzip it, and set your printer for sixty (60) lines per page, with
a six (6) character left hand margin, using 8-1/2" x 11" paper.
Punch holes for a loose leaf binder and keep it on your desk.  Again,
instant access.
