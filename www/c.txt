Q Enabling the most warnings for the gcc compiler

A I would strongly recommend enabling the option to have your compiler warn you about this, if you compiler has such an option. In gcc, the option is 
<pre>-Wwrite-strings -W -Wall -pedantic -O</pre>
F'rexample, "gcc" without any options specified is a Rather Different compiler than with these switches
